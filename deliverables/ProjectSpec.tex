\section{Problem Statement}

    \subsection{Introduction and Context}

        Technical documentation plays a critical role in helping developers understand, implement, operate and maintain software systems. In enterprise environments, documentation is the primary interface between developers and complex
        systems, making clarity and accessibility essential. However, despite its importance, technical documentation remains predominantly static, text-based and difficult to navigate. As systems grow in complexity, dynamic processes such
        as data flows, dependencies and interactions are often poorly represented in traditional documentation formats. Consequently, many users often struggle to find the information they need, leading to frustration, errors and inefficiencies. This 
        raises the need for innovative solutions that can enhance the user experience and improve comprehension of technical documentation.

    \subsection{Existing Technologies}

    There are several existing technologies which address parts of the problem but do not yet offer a comprehensive solution. These include:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Static and Web-Based Documentation:}
                Different Platforms like GitBook, ReadTheDocs and Markdown-based tools offer well-structured and accessible documentation but lack interactivity and visualization capabilities. Information is conveyed effectively through text and images
                but remains static and fails to envision the dynamic nature of modern software systems.
            \item \textbf{AI Assistants:}
                In the last few years, the rise of AI-powered assistants like ChatGPT and Gemini have been transformative. These tools can understand and interpret technical text, summarize content and answer user queries. Yet, these
                assistants operate in isolation from the documentation itself, requiring users to switch contexts and manually input queries, disconnecting them from visual elements and offering limited support for the understanding of
                system architecture and interactions.
            \item \textbf{Augmented Reality Applications:}
                Industrial AR tools, such as PTC Vuforia, Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides and Scope AR, have been used to overlay digital information onto real-world objects. These solutions enhance spatial understanding and are particularly useful in maintenance
                and training contexts. However, they typically rely on specific and expensive hardware, such as the HoloLens, or complex 3D models, thus limiting their accessibility for general users.
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Gaps in Current Solutions}

        Despite the advancements in AR and AI technologies, the current solutions exhibit several limitations:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Lack of Integration between AR and AI:}
                Visualization (AR) and comprehension (AI) are treated as separate domains. There is limited integration or implementation that combines the strengths of both to deliver a seamless user experience.
            \item \textbf{Limited Visual Comprehension:}
                Text and 2D diagrams are insufficient for conveying complex interactions and dynamic processes. Current documentation formats do not effectively utilize visual aids to enhance understanding.
            \item \textbf{Hardware and Platform Barriers:}
                Most AR implementations are dependent on specialized hardware, such as the HoloLens or AR glasses, which are costly or not widely available. This restricts the accessibility of AR-enhanced documentation to a broader audience.
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Problem Definition}

    Given the limitations of existing documentation systems and the potential of emerging technologies, there is a need for an innovative solution which can be easily accessible, interactive and capable of enhancing
    the understanding of technical documentation. In order to address this need, the project aims to develop an AI-powered mobile application that uses AR technology to augment technical documentation. The proposed system must 
    allow users to point their mobile devices at a technical diagram and view interactive AR overlays that explain components, relationships and interactions. At the same time, an integrated AI assistant, IBM Watson/Granite,
    will be available to answer user queries and provide additional context.  

        Therefore, this project aims to bridge the gap between visual comprehension and intelligent interaction in technical documentation, ultimately demonstrating how static documents can become interactive, explainable and user-friendly.

\section{System Architecture}
Provide a high-level overview of the system architecture. Include diagrams where appropriate to illustrate the system components and their interactions.

    \subsection{Design Pattern}

    The design pattern which will be adopted for this project is the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern. This pattern is well-suited for applications that require a clear separation
    of concerns between the user interface and logic, making it easier to manage and test the application. Furthermore, the MVVM pattern facilitates a more modular and maintainable
    codebase, which is essential for the iterative development process planned for this project. The image below illustrates the MVVM architecture which will be used in the project.
